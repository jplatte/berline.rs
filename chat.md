# Rust Berlin Matrix Chat

Rust Berlin hosts their own [Matrix] server under rustch.at.

It has 2 major channels for our meetups:

* `#hack-and-learn:chat.berline.rs` ([Join Channel link][hack-and-learn-channel]).
* `#rust-and-tell:chat.berline.rs` ([Join Channel link][rust-and-tell-channel]).

If you already have a Matrix account you can join the channels by clicking the `Join Channel` links above.

## How to create an account

If you don't have an account you can create one on our server.

1. Open the [Element webapp][element] on RustChat.
    * Alternative [Matrix clients] work as well.
2. Click "Create Account".
3. Pick a username and a password.
    * Caveat: we currently don't allow password resets and can't recover them either. Remember your password!
4. Complete the registration.
5. Now join one of our channels.
